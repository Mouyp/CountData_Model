# CountData_Model

This project centers around a detailed analysis of how various factors within a customer database influence the frequency of customer service calls and chatbot interactions. The primary aim is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, particularly in relation to the adoption of solar panels by long-time customers of an energy retailer.
